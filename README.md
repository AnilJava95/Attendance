A desktop Java attendance program that takes a picture of an ID card, extracts the text (OCR), finds the piece of text (student id number) it is looking for among all the text,  and puts the attendance information in the database. The teacher can change the class and week. The teacher can extract the database to text and CSV files. This is the Netbeans project along with the poster, progress reports, and the main report.
