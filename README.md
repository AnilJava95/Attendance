# Attendance
A Java Swing GUI attendance program that takes a picture of an ID card, extracts the text (OCR), finds the student id number among all text,  and puts the attendance information in the database. The instructor can set the class and week, and extract the database to text and CSV files. This is the Netbeans project along with the poster, progress reports, and the main report.
